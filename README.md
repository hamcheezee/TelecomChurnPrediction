# Telecom Churn Prediction <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/bandiatindra/telecom-churn-prediction/data"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/click-for%20dataset-blue" alt="Dataset Badge"></a>

Built models to predict whether a customer is likely to switch to another telecom service provider (churn) based on historical data and various features associated with the customer

### Customer churn influencing factors

Month-to-month contracts, a lack of online security, and technical support appear to be positively related to churn. While tenure and two-year contracts appear to be negatively correlated.
It's interesting to note that churn appears to be adversely correlated with services like online backup, tech support, streaming TV, etc. that don't require an internet connection. 

### Grouping of customers who have ceased to use the service (Churned)

From the picture, it can be observed that there are five groups of customers who have already discontinued using the service:

â€¢ Group 1 (Blue): This comprises customers with a low service life and low monthly expenses. It is evident that these customers tend to come and go without forming a lasting attachment to any camp service.

â€¢ Group 2 (Green): This group consists of customers with a moderate to very long service life and low monthly costs. The density of this group is relatively sparse compared to others, suggesting it is a smaller group. These customers may include general individuals with modest income who might cease using the service for various reasons.

â€¢ Group 3 (Red): Here, we have customers with a low service life and relatively high monthly expenses. This group represents the largest number of customers, characterized by a higher density than any other group. The primary reason for discontinuing the service in this group may stem from the high monthly fees, as well as the availability of cheaper alternatives in other camps.

â€¢ Group 4 (Purple): This group encompasses customers with a moderate service life and relatively high monthly expenses. Similar to Group 3, the termination of service in this group may be attributed to the high monthly fees, with potential additional factors such as hesitations or preferences for other camps.

â€¢ Group 5 (Gold): This is an intriguing group with customers having a long service life and high monthly expenses. Considered as valuable customers who should be retained, they seem indifferent to the cost. The reason for discontinuation in this group may not be the cost itself but could be due to service-related issues or other factors that warrant further investigation. To prevent the loss of these valuable customers in the future, a more in-depth study is necessary.
